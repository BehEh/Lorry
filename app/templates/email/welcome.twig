<p>{% trans %}{{brand}} works a bit differently compared to other download sites. In order to publish a scenario or pack you first need to create a corresponding addon. The addons tracks general information, like the title, an introduction and which game it belongs to. You can then create a release for the addon, which has a version number, a detailed description and tracks the actual files. Once you have created a release you can publish it. When players search for your addon, they will always be pointed to the latest release.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}You can send us any feedback you have on the {{contact_page}}. Let's make {{brand}} a useful and awesome site.{% endtrans %}</p>

<p>{% trans %}Once again, thank you for testing {{brand}}!{% endtrans %}</p>
